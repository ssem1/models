# malgo models

In the Python section we'll primarily be doing proof of concept work. Primary libraries used will be: TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn. But please feel free to use any other libraries you're comfortable with.

## Getting Started

Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Also pip install numpy matplotlib scipy, pip install scikit-learn --> pip install pillow --> pip install h5py --> pip install tensorflow --> pip install keras should cover all needed libraries for use in this part of the repo.

### Contributions

We love contributors and any models you build can be included via Pull Requests; review will occur ASAP

Over time, models and statistics will become out-of-date and updates are encouraged

The goal is to separate papers and studies from models, but if a paper accompanies a model free to keep them together
