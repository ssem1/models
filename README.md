# malgo models

This repo is dedicated to models, case-studies, and general analytics that power the malgo toolset. Our current focus is implementing models for PoC and studying the various industry standards on usage. Eventually these models will be implemented and used for the build in-progress web application over in the malgo repo.

## Getting Started

Primarily models will be built in Python. However a handful will be written using TensorFlow.js and another handful built using ML.NET. Build instructions can be found in the individual repos sorted by language.

### Prerequisites

Any additional dependencies are outlined within the model you're toying with, papers should always be made available in .pdf and .tex (no exceptions)

### Contributions

We love contributors and any models you build can be included via Pull Requests; review will occur ASAP

Over time, models and statistics will become out-of-date and updates are encouraged

The goal is to separate papers and studies from models, but if a paper accompanies a model free to keep them together
